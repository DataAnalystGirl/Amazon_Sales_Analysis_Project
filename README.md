# Amazon_Sales_Analysis_Project
This is the beginning of my data analysis journey. I chose Amazon sales dataset because I have been a customer since they first opened. I really enjoy their customer support and their fast delivery options. Those reasons alone piqued my interest on how well their sales are doing.

Problem Statement

In the retail industry customer sales is driven by understanding customer sales behavior. In order to achieve high satisfactory customer service a company must know product trends to optimize operations for the business. This data is geared towards online retail transactions. The goal is to identify key issues that can impact business performance. My role as a Data Analyst is to answer and gather data to determine a data analysis that will provide guidance on business decisions. 

Analytics Questions

I had to identify business questions before beginning the analysis related to our data: 

Which country has the most sales?
What types of products do customers order the most?
Number of sales over the past several years?
Top 5 best selling products?
Which month has the most sales?
